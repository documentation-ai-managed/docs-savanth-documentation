## Organizing Content Hierarchies

Plan your documentation with a clear hierarchy: start with high-level overviews, then drill into specifics. Use H2 for main topics, H3 for subtopics, and H4 for details. Avoid skipping levels to maintain readability.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Limit pages to 1500-2000 words. Split long guides into focused subpages.
</Callout>

### Steps to Build Your Hierarchy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Map User Journeys" icon="map">
    Identify key user paths: onboarding, API usage, troubleshooting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Navigation" icon="menu">
    Use sidebar menus for quick access. Group related pages under sections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Navigation" icon="search">
    Walk through as a new user. Ensure paths take `<3` clicks to core info.
  </Step>

    A --> E[API Reference]
    E --> F[Endpoints]
    E --> G[SDKs]
```

## Using Markdown and Rich Media

Write concise prose with active voice. Enhance with components like `<Steps>`, `<Tabs>`, and code blocks. Always escape special characters in text, such as `{API_KEY}` or `<100ms`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Markdown" icon="edit">
    Use standard syntax for lists and tables.

    | Element     | Syntax Example          |
    |-------------|-------------------------|
    | Bold        | `**text**`             |
    | Inline Code | `` `code` ``           |
    | Links       | `[text](url)`          |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rich Components" icon="layers">
    Embed interactive elements for better engagement.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Multi-Language Code Examples

Show platform-specific code with `<CodeGroup>`.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch('https://api.savanth.io/v1/projects', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` }
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
  ```
  ```python
  import requests
  headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_KEY}'}
  response = requests.get('https://api.savanth.io/v1/projects', headers=headers)
  data = response.json()
  print(data)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="info">
  Add `show-lines={true}` to code blocks for debugging complex snippets.
</Callout>

## Collaborating with Team Members

Set up version control and review processes early. Assign owners to sections and use pull requests for changes.

### Collaboration Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Draft Changes" icon="edit-3">
    Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b docs-improve-api-guide`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review with Team" icon="eye">
    Open a PR and request reviews from at least two team members.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge and Deploy" icon="git-merge">
    Merge after approvals. Preview builds automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Advanced Tips" default-open="false">
    Use labels like `docs`, `review-needed` in PRs. Schedule bi-weekly doc sprints.
    
    Integrate with CI/CD: Lint Markdown with tools like `markdownlint`.

Maintain consistency by defining a style guide: second-person voice, present tense, and precise terms. Regularly audit for outdated content to keep your savanth documentation fresh and reliable.
